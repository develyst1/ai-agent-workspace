# Board — portfolio-nichaphon

> Single source of truth for CURRENT state. Update me at the end of every session
> (see PROTOCOL.md). **File discipline (workspace-root `DISPATCHER.md`, binds all
> roles):** detail lives in the TASK/REQ file; a board cell is ONE line (status +
> date + owner + pointer); a log entry is ≤ 15 lines. Never paste evidence or
> keep old text here.

## Project info

- Description: **Personal portfolio / freelance-services website for Nichaphon
  Sayvav**, live at `portfolio.develyst.online`. Six routes — Home, About,
  Services, Portfolio, Blog, Contact — all static content, no backend.
- Code repository (single repo, brownfield — a working site already ships):
  logical name **`portfolio-nichaphon-web`**; absolute path only in the
  workspace-root `machine.local.md`. Frontend lives in `front/`.
- Stack (verified from the repo 2026-08-29): Next.js 15.5.24 App Router ·
  React 19.2 · TypeScript 5 · **Mantine 8.3.18** + `@tabler/icons-react` ·
  CSS Modules via `postcss-preset-mantine`. **No Tailwind, no backend, no
  database** — the repo-root `README.md` claiming NestJS + Prisma + Tailwind is
  stale; `front/README.md` is the accurate one.
- As-built survey (read-only, gathered before the team existed):
  `../project-docs/as-built-survey-2026-08-29.md`. It is source material, not a
  requirement — Porter still writes the first REQ from the human's words.
- Team: Porter (PM) · Sober (SA Lead) · Fern (FE — the only engineer).
  **No BE role** (no backend exists) and **no QA role** (the human is the
  acceptance tester, via Porter). If a backend ever appears, that is the
  human's scope decision, not a team improvisation.
- 🤖 Run mode: **DISPATCHER** (workspace-root `DISPATCHER.md`) — one session
  spawns the roles as subagents. Files remain the only channel; PROTOCOL
  unchanged. Dispatcher run log: `dispatcher-state.md`.
- Standing rules: git writes (`add`/`commit`/`push`, branches) are the human's
  alone — the team hands work off as edited files on `develop`. **Nobody
  deploys**: the live droplet, `pm2`, ssh, `merge-workflow.sh` and
  `release-workflow.sh` are the human's hands only. Real-world material (copy,
  screenshots, client facts) arrives via DATA REQUEST into `../project-docs/`.
- Branches on the repo: `develop` (current checkout) · `main` · `production`
  (+ `origin/D1`). Which branch a change targets is the human's call via Porter.
